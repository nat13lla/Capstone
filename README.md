## Project Aim:
The objective of this project is to create a model that can be used to predict whether an f1 driver will achieve points at a particular race, using their starting position and other relevant variables. The user should be able to choose the driver and the circuit and input a starting position, for the model to predict whether that driver could reach the top 10 to achieve points in that race. The function would use a logistic regression model to predict the outcome. I have a keen interest in Formula 1 and I believe it would be fascinating to explore past data to analyze the relationship between qualifying results/ starting positions and race outcomes.


## Data Collections : [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/)
I gathered relevant F1 data from the Data repository API, which contains comprehensive historical data on Formula One. I combined several datasets, including [Race Results](http://ergast.com/mrd/methods/results/) , [Driver Information](http://ergast.com/mrd/methods/drivers/) , [Constructor Information](http://ergast.com/mrd/methods/constructors/) , [Circuit Information](http://ergast.com/mrd/methods/circuits/) and more.



## EDA
Exploratory data analysis allowed us to gain insights into circuit analysis, driver nationality, championship wins, and other key factors influencing driver and constructor performance. This analysis was crucial in understanding the sport and informing our modeling approach


## Machine Learning Models:
The main metric I plan on using is accuracy, aiming to achieve a consistent level across both the test data and the train data. The [example model]( https://f1-predictor.gjd.one/) claimed to have base initial accuracy of between 0.50 and 0.68, across all models so I am aiming for a final accuracy of around 0.75 or higher to create a usable and functional model using Logistic Regression.
